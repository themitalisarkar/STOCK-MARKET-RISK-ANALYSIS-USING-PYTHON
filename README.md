# STOCK-MARKET-RISK-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock market behavior and assessing financial risk using historical stock price data. It applies statistical techniques, data visualization, and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate stock volatility, correlation, and potential downside risk.

# Dataset
Historical stock prices collected using Yahoo Finance API
Stocks analyzed: AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT, JNJ, WMT, NKE

# Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Pandas DataReader
Statistical & Probabilistic Modeling

# Key Analysis Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Daily return and volatility analysis
Correlation and pairwise relationship analysis
Value at Risk (VaR) using:
Historical (Empirical) Method
Monte Carlo Simulation
# Stock price forecasting using Geometric Brownian Motion

# Key Insights
1) Technology stocks show strong inter-correlation
2) Higher volatility stocks carry greater downside risk
3) Monte Carlo simulation effectively estimates future price uncertainty
4) Risk increases significantly during high volatility periods
