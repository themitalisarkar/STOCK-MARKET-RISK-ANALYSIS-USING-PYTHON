# STOCK-MARKET-RISK-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON

Developed an end-to-end quantitative risk analysis model using Python to assess and forecast the financial risk associated with equity investments, with a specific focus on Google (GOOGL) stock. The project involved collecting and preprocessing historical stock price data, performing exploratory data analysis to understand price trends, volatility patterns, and return distributions.

Implemented Monte Carlo Simulation to generate thousands of possible future price paths, enabling probabilistic forecasting of stock behavior under varying market conditions. Applied Value at Risk (VaR) techniques—including historical, parametric, and Monte Carlo-based VaR—to quantify potential financial losses at different confidence levels. Additionally, conducted stress testing by simulating extreme market scenarios to evaluate portfolio resilience during high-volatility or market-crash conditions.

Utilized statistical methods such as log returns, volatility estimation, correlation analysis, and probability distributions to model risk accurately. The project provided insights into downside risk exposure, potential drawdowns, and risk-return trade-offs, supporting data-driven investment decision-making. Visualized results using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clearly communicate risk metrics and scenario outcomes.

This project demonstrates strong proficiency in financial analytics, quantitative modeling, Python programming, and practical risk management techniques commonly used in investment banking, asset management, and financial analytics roles.
